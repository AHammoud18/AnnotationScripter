# AnnotationScripter

#### This script is being created to simplify a way to create a JSON file of image annotations necessary for machine learning models.
#### In my case CoreML requires image attributes along with the training data

###### This script will help by opening the folder path of images and allowing the user to highlight the region where they want the model to learn from, each image confirmed will append to a JSON file that can be exported once finished
